{"name":"Old Norse for Japanese Beginners","tagline":"homemade LaTeX-typeset learning resource for Japanese beginners of Old Norse.","body":"# About the project\r\nThis is a personal project by [@GreekFellows](https://twitter.com/GreekFellows) to write a beginner's book for Japanese people interested in learning Old Norse, an ancient Scandinavian language.\r\n\r\nThe only three reasons I am writing this book is because\r\n* Old Norse is amazingly fun;\r\n* there are not many learning resources written in Japanese; and\r\n* I can revisit concepts as I write the book.\r\n\r\n# How to get the book\r\nIf you have `git`, simply `clone` this repository. If you have not, you can download the repository as a ZIP from GitHub by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/GreekFellows/oldnorsefornoobs-jp/archive/master.zip).\r\n\r\nThe book is written in LaTeX. The repository includes both the source file `.tex` and a compiled PDF `.pdf`.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
